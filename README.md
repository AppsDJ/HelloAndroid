# Hello, Android!

The project HelloAndroid is the first project for Google Android Basics Scholarship with Udacity.

The project consists of a simple layout with a combination of various views to depict a Contact information ‘page’ for Udacity. The project currently serves as a simple experimentation with nesting RelativeLayouts and various views. It remains purposefully inefficient. 

When built and run the project displays on a mobile device (Nexus 5, in this case) like this:

### Landscape

This project will subsequently be converted to use the newer and more efficient ConstraintLayout.
