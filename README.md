Hello, Android!

The project HelloAndroid is the first project for Google Android Basics Scholarship with Udacity.

The project consists of a simple layout with a combinations of various views to depict a Contact information view (or page) for Udacity.

When built and run the project displays on a mobile device (Nexus 5, in this case) like this:

Portrait

Landscape

This project will subsequently be converted to use the newer and more efficient ConstraintLayout.
